# RandomPasswordGenerator
 A Python script to generate a random password of 8 characters in accordance with ASCII code.
 
 --------------------------------------
 Each time the program is run, a new password will be generated randomly. The passwords generated will be 8 characters long and will have to include the following characters in any order:

2 uppercase letters from A to Z,
2 lowercase letters from a to z,
2 digits from 0 to 9,
2 punctuation signs such as !, ?, â€œ, # etc.

All uppercase letters from A to Z have an ASCII code between 65 (=A) and 90 (=Z).

About ASCII code-
The ASCII code (Pronounced ask-ee) is a code for representing English characters as numbers, with each character assigned a number from 0 to 127. For example, the ASCII code for uppercase M is 77. The extended ASCII code contains 256 characters (using numbers from 0 to 255).
